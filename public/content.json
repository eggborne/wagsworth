I loved getting to interact with so many different breeds! Giving soap mohawks to sudsy puppies are some of my favorite childhood memories, and those times led me to apprentice and later work in grooming shops all over the country.",

        "Depending on your dog's coat type, you should aim between 5-8 weeks. Softer coats (poodle, maltese, shih-tzu, bichon, etc.) should be maintained closer to the 4-5 week mark, whereas shorter and coarser coats can be stretched toward 6-8 weeks.",

      ]

    {
      "question": ["Is it ok to bathe my dog myself in between grooms?"],
      "answer": [
        "I would not recommend bathing soft coated dogs between grooms. Without proper drying and brushing, you can risk matting which could unfortunately result in shaving. If you absolutely have to bathe between grooms (mud and dirt happens), then be sure to dry and brush thoroughly after the bath."

    },
    {
      "question": [
        "What age to should I start bringing my puppy in for grooming?"
      ],
      "answer": [
        "Starting them as young as 10-12 weeks is a great time to start grooming. Bringing them in at an early age while keeping a consistent schedule will ease them into the process and will create a more positive experience for them in the future."
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": ["Can I stay with my dog and watch?"],
      "answer": [
        "This is a common concern among many dog owners. Unfortunately, I do not let owners stay during the groom. This is not only a safety matter, but dogs will generally respond to the grooming process much better when the owner is not around. Creating a trusting relationship is a very important step between you and your groomer. Make sure you're comfortable enough with them to ask questions and keep an open and honest dialogue."
